# How To

We opted for a minimalistic visual footprint to mostly keep the Overlay out of the User's face whenever it is not exactly relevant:

- The Overlay is **not** visible unless it detects an ongoing **ARAM Champ-Select**.
- The Overlay does **not** appear in the Taskbar. Instead, look for it in your **System Tray**.
- You may choose to **hide** the Overlay at any time using the **"Toggle Visibility"** feature.

The **"Reconnect to LCU"** feature is mostly technical. In general, it is advised to simply restart the application in case of unusual behavior.
